Paraglide is a minimalist Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework for PHP5.

Models are handled by Paragon, an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).
Views are handled by PHP itself, and rendered with a simple method from a controller which passes variables.
Controllers are regular classes that follow a defined convention for naming methods.

Paraglide handles routing, hooks, configuration, URLs, and some helper methods.
Paraglide provides conventions for keeping your application organized.
